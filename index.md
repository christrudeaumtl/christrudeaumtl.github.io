# Welcome!
Cities are loud. We can make them enjoyable, dynamic, just and liveable without making them silent. 

I'm doing my PhD on the distributive justice of sound environments (good and bad) across cities. This site is mostly to collect my thoughts. I'm going to be adding to this page over time.

## Projects
I'm working on a few projects at the moment.
