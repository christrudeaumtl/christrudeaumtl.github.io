# Welcome!
Cities are loud. We can make them enjoyable, dynamic, just and liveable without making them silent. 

I'm doing my PhD on the distributive justice of (good and bad) sound environments across cities. This site is mostly to collect my thoughts. I'm going to be adding to this page over time.

## Projects
I'm working on a few interesting and related projects at the moment.
